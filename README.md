# NS2-Final
## COPY AT YOUR OWN RISK
This NS-2 simulation is mainly for Wired and Wireless(Static) 802.11. For bonus I completed Satellite, Wired to wireless, queue size monitoring, per node throughput calculation. 
For routing protocol modification, I used a paper on RAODV (Random AODV). 
For tcp congestion window modification and rtt calculation, I used simple intuitions.
